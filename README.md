# Simpra Code Case

A brief description of the project can go here.

## Technologies Used

This project utilizes the following technologies:

- RxSwift: Used for managing asynchronous operations using a functional reactive programming approach.
- Dependency Injection: Employed to loosely couple application components and create a more maintainable and testable codebase.
- Swinject: A library that facilitates dependency injection.

## Design Patterns Used

In this project, I'm using the following design patterns:

- Coordinator: Used to manage and coordinate different screens and flow within the application. Preferred for organizing different app flows.
- MVVM-C (Model-View-ViewModel-Coordinator): A design pattern where the user interface (View) is kept separate from logical functions (ViewModel) and navigation management (Coordinator).

## Notes

The default password has been set as "123456". All other inputs will result in a "wrong password" error.
